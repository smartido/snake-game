## About

Snake is a classic video game from the mid-1970s that has remained popular ever since. In the game, the player maneuvers a snake that moves around the bounded board while eats food (or other defenseless createures) avoiding colliding with both walls and itself. Each time the snake eats, it grows one position, increasing the difficulty of the game. The player controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left or right) and the snake's body follows. An added restriction is that the player cannot stop the snake's movement while the game is in progress or move backwards.

This version is a clone of the original snake game incorporated as the default game on Nokia phones in 1998.
